        The task at hand was to conceptualize and design a novel pair of earbuds,
        accompanied by an innovative charging case. Utilizing Cinema 4D, we 
        model, texture, light, and animate  designs,
        .<br>
        we were tasked with brainstorming and researching cutting-edge ideas 
        for a new pair of earbuds. These concepts were expected to be both 
        aesthetically pleasing and functionally superior<br>
        In addition to the earbuds, we were challenged to design a charging case
         that not only complements the earbuds but also incorporates state-of-the
         -art features and aesthetics.  And after designing we was asked to make promotional images for the earbuds<br>
         With  concepts in hand, we ventured into the world of Cinema 4D and 
         skillfully navigated the software, meticulously modeling the earbuds
          and charging cases to bring their imaginative concepts to life.
        This phase involved intricate details such as texture and lighting
         to ensure their designs were visually striking and true to their vision
